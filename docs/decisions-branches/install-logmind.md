## 2026-05-15 02:08 - Initialize logmind decision tracking

**Reasoning:** Starting structured decision logging for this project to maintain clear documentation of architectural choices and provide context for AI agents.

**Alternatives considered:** Manual decision documentation, ADR (Architecture Decision Records)

**Implications:**
- All significant decisions should now be logged using `logmind.log()`
- AI agents will have access to decision history via docs/decisions.md
- Git history will serve as an audit trail for all decisions
